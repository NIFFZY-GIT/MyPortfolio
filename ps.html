              <p>
                Professional skills, also known as soft skills or employability
                skills, are essential non-technical, interpersonal abilities
                needed for workplace success. Unlike technical skills, which are
                industry-specific, professional skills are transferable and
                applicable across various roles and industries. Key examples
                include teamwork, problem-solving, adaptability, leadership, and
                communication. Workplace skills can be categorized into three
                types,

                Today’s session was an eye opener on how to create a strong CV
                and cover letter. I learned the importance of tailoring my CV to
                match each job, highlighting relevant skills and experiences,
                and including keywords to pass ATS systems. The key
                sections personal info, professional summary, work experience,
                education, and skillsshould be clear and concise, showcasing
                strengths effectively. Cover letters, on the other hand, should
                show research on the company and link my skills to their needs
                while adding a personal touch. The feedback on our CVs was
                especially helpful, showing me how small adjustments can make a
                big difference. I feel much more confident in presenting myself
                professionally.

                and managing time wisely, we can ensure that meetings are
                productive and meaningful. Active listening and actionable
                follow ups transform discussions into results, making every
                meeting a step toward progress. With continuous reflection and
                improvement, meetings can evolve into powerful tools for
                achieving both individual and collective goals.

              <h2>Mastering Email Etiquette for Professional Success</h2>
              <p>
                This chapter was a quick refresher on email etiquette, focusing
                on key practices to maintain professionalism in written
                communication. While informal emails allow for flexibility,
                formal emails demand attention to tone, structure, and clarity.
                Writing an email isn’t just about the content—it’s about
                ensuring it’s polished, respectful, and purposeful. By following
                simple guidelines, we can make a positive impression and
                communicate effectively.

              <h2>Self Reflection on Email Etiquette</h2>
              <p>
                Reflecting on email etiquette, I’ve realized how small details
                can significantly impact communication. Writing professional
                emails isn’t just about conveying a message; it’s about creating
                clarity and trust. I’ve become more mindful of structuring
                emails with a clear subject, polished tone, and proper closing.
                Proofreading has been a game changer, helping me catch small
                mistakes that could affect my professionalism. I also learned
                the importance of patience and follow ups, especially in busy
                work environments. This lesson has reinforced how thoughtful
                communication can leave a lasting impression.

                errors that can distract from your professionalism. Following up
                politely when needed shows respect for the recipient’s time
                while staying proactive. Ultimately, a thoughtful email isn’t
                just about delivering a message it’s about building trust and
                leaving a positive impression.

              <h2>Key Concepts in Research Design and Abstract Writing</h2>
              <p>
                This lesson covered research design and writing abstracts.
                Research design serves as a blueprint for conducting studies,
                ensuring relevance and efficiency. It involves components like
                population, sample, time frame, data collection methods, and
                data analysis. Research approaches can be qualitative (e.g.
                case studies, interviews) or quantitative (e.g., surveys,
                experiments), with the option to combine both for stronger
                results. 
              </p>
<br>
                <p>The lesson also revisited sampling methods briefly, as
                previously covered in probability and statistics. Writing
                abstracts was highlighted as a crucial skill. Abstracts provide
                a concise overview of a research paper, including the
                introduction, purpose, method, results, and conclusion. They are
                written last but serve as the first impression of the paper,
                requiring clarity and precision. A hands on activity reinforced
                the concepts.

              <p>
                This lesson gave me a deeper understanding of research design
                and the importance of writing effective abstracts. I now see
                research design as a critical step that ensures studies are not
                only relevant but also conducted efficiently. Learning the
                differences between qualitative and quantitative approaches has
                made me more confident in choosing the right methods for various
                research scenarios. Writing abstracts stood out as an essential
                skill, as it requires condensing an entire study into a clear
                and concise summary. I’ve realized how crucial it is to
                communicate findings effectively, as the abstract is often the
                first thing readers see. This session has equipped me with
                valuable tools that will enhance both my research and writing
                skills, preparing me for academic and professional challenges.

                Dining etiquette, or table manners, is an essential skill that
                helps us navigate formal and casual dining settings with ease
                and confidence. This session focused on the key aspects of

                  <li>
                    <strong>Seating Arrangements:</strong> The host signals
                    guests to their seats, while guests should wait for
                    guidance. Maintain good posture while seated, and keep your
                    elbows off the table. Silence your phone and place your bag
                    on a protected, elevated spot.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Table Setting Basics:</strong> Plates are centered
                    with napkins placed on top. Forks are on the left (salad and
                    main course), knives and spoons on the right (soup spoon and
                    main course knife), and dessert utensils at the top. Bread
                    plates are on the left, glasses (water, champagne, wine) on
                    the right.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Using the Napkin:</strong> Place it on your lap
                    during the meal. If stepping away, place the napkin on your
                    chair to signal your return. When leaving the table for
                    good, place it neatly on the left side of the plate.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Dining Techniques:</strong> Start with bread and
                    butter, then move to the salad course and main course, using
                    the appropriate utensils. Learn and use either the American
                    or European style of eating. After finishing, place your
                    utensils in a 12:00 to 6:00 or 10:00 to 4:00 position on the
                    plate.

              <h2>Self-Reflection: Dining Etiquette</h2>
              <p>
                This session on dining etiquette was both practical and
                insightful, and it made me realize how much these small details
                matter in formal and casual settings. I never thought about how
                something as simple as placing a napkin or using the correct
                fork could leave such a lasting impression. It was interesting
                to learn how posture, seating arrangements, and even the way we
                hold our utensils play a role in creating a comfortable dining
                atmosphere for everyone involved. The practical approach helped
                me grasp these concepts more effectively, and I could imagine
                myself applying these skills in real world scenarios. I
                especially liked the discussion about American and European
                dining styles—it felt like I was learning something truly
                universal and adaptable. It’s not just about looking polished;
                it’s about respecting others and being mindful of your
                surroundings. This session gave me a new appreciation for the
                finer details of dining etiquette. It’s a skill I feel confident
                about improving further, and I’m excited to apply these manners
                whenever the opportunity arises.

                Dining etiquette is more than just following rules—it’s about
                creating a comfortable and respectful atmosphere for everyone at
                the table. From seating arrangements to using the correct
                utensils and understanding cultural dining styles, these skills
                reflect both professionalism and mindfulness. This session
                taught me that small actions, like proper napkin placement or
                utensil handling, can leave a lasting impression. With practice,
                these habits will not only enhance my confidence but also help
                me navigate formal dining settings with ease and grace.

              <h2>Exploring Emotional Intelligence</h2>
              <p>
                Today’s session, led by guest lecturer Hubika Joshi, was an
                eye opening experience about emotional intelligence. It was all
                about understanding and managing emotions in a way that helps us
                grow. We started with a fun activity identifying emotions
                through emojis, which led to deeper discussions about feelings
                like anger, sadness, fear, enjoyment, love, and surprise. I
                found it fascinating how emotions like anger can spiral into
                other negative feelings, while positive ones like happiness and
                love can really improve our well being. We also learned about
                emotional leakage how hidden emotions sneak out through things
                like our voice, expressions, or energy. It made me think about
                how much we unknowingly reveal about ourselves. The concept of
                emotional intelligence really clicked for me; it’s not just
                about recognizing and managing our own feelings but also
                understanding others. Some great advice from the session was to
                stay goal oriented, think about solving problems instead of
                dwelling on emotions, and practice mindfulness, empathy, and
                self awareness. We ended with a reflection on our favorite and
                least favorite emotions, which was a nice way to tie it all
                together. What really stuck with me was when the lecturer said,
                “The session would be great if you could actually apply the
                things on yourself in the future.” It’s a reminder that learning
                is just the first step what matters is how we use it.

                    <strong>Understanding Emotions:</strong> Emotions like
                    anger, sadness, fear, and enjoyment influence our behavior
                    and relationships. Positive emotions foster well being,

                    <strong>Emotional Leakage:</strong> Hidden emotions can
                    unintentionally be revealed through voice, expressions, or
                    energy levels. Recognizing these helps us understand others
                    better.

                    identifying and managing one’s emotions while empathizing

                    self regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.

              <p>
                Today's session on emotional intelligence was a real eye opener.
                Hubika Joshi’s approach to understanding emotions was practical
                and relatable, which made everything click. Identifying emotions
                through emojis was such a simple yet powerful way to start, and
                it really got me thinking about how much emotions like anger,
                sadness, and fear can shape our lives if not managed well. The
                discussion on emotional leakage how our hidden feelings show
                through little things like expressions or tone—made me realize
                how much we reveal without even knowing it. The quote about
                having a goal oriented mindset stuck with me. It’s such a
                straightforward idea, but it made me think about how often I let
                emotions take over instead of focusing on solutions. I also
                learned how important mindfulness and empathy arenot just for
                understanding others but for being in control of myself. This
                session wasn’t just about learning; it felt like a reminder to
                work on my emotional awareness every day. Applying these lessons
                in real life is definitely going to take effort, but I’m ready
                to try.

                This session on emotional intelligence was a reminder of how
                much our emotions shape our lives and interactions.
                Understanding and managing emotions isn’t just about

                others.

              <h2>Understanding Project Proposals: A Key to Success</h2>
              <p>
                As software engineering undergraduates, preparing project
                proposals is essential for tackling real world problems in the
                industry. A project proposal, often read in 5-10 minutes by
                clients, must be concise, clear, and convincing. There are two
                types of proposals, external and internal.

              <p>
                This session on project proposals taught me the importance of
                clear, concise communication in presenting ideas. Understanding
                the differences between external and internal proposals helped
                me see how to tailor content for clients or internal teams. The
                focus on problem solving and meaningful solutions resonated with
                me, emphasizing the need to think beyond just technical aspects.
                I’m excited to apply these skills in real world scenarios,
                especially as we evaluate the food festival project. This

              <h2>A Memorable Food Festival Experience</h2>
              <p>
                The Food Festival on October 8, 2024, was a vibrant event that
                gave us, as students, an incredible chance to showcase our
                skills in organizing, teamwork, and creativity. My team’s stall,
                "Kottu x Mojito," brought a unique twist to the festival,
                offering Sri Lankan Kottu and refreshing Mojitos. These
                crowd favorites added a burst of flavor to the event, and seeing
                people enjoy what we prepared was truly rewarding. Despite the
                short notice about the time and venue, we adapted quickly and
                worked tirelessly to set up a stall that stood out. From
                budgeting to decorating and managing sales, every step was a
                learning experience. Competing with other creative stalls was
                challenging, but it pushed us to step up our game and deliver
                something special. The festival wasn’t just about selling
                food—it was about building connections, working together, and
                stepping out of our comfort zones to create something memorable.
                It was an unforgettable experience that taught me skills I’ll
                carry forward, both personally and professionally.

                Today's session, led by guest lecturer Shenal Rajakarunanayake,
                focused on negotiation skills and how they are essential in both
                personal and professional settings. The session began with
                defining negotiation as a discussion aimed at reaching an
                agreement that satisfies both parties. Effective negotiation
                requires skills such as self awareness, active listening, open
                body language, and competence, all of which contribute to a
                charismatic personality.

                Today’s session on negotiation skills was practical and
                inspiring. Shenal Rajakarunanayake’s engaging style made the
                concepts easy to understand, especially the importance of a
                Win Win approach and the BATNA strategy. Learning how
                preparation, empathy, and knowing your walk away point can
                strengthen negotiations was eye opening. Even though we couldn’t
                present our group activity, it helped me see the value of
                collaboration and strategy. This session has motivated me to
                improve my negotiation skills for both personal and professional
                growth.
